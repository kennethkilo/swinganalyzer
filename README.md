# My Personal Project - A Biomechanical Analysis Tool

## An application that allows users to *draw* on images or videos

**Application Features**
- Loading in an image/file
- Drawing on the image/file (e.g. A line from position (x1,y1) to (x2,y2))
- Deleting/erasing drawings
- Saving drawings

**Application Audience**
- Sports enthusiasts
- Sport coaches

**Project Inspiration**
- As a golfing enthusiast myself, I've often wondered if my body was doing what it was supposed to.
AKA *Feel vs Real*. Being able to have an application where I can draw a line on top of a body segment and see the relative
position changes will help me improve my swing!

## User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to specify shape details and locations
- For example, a solid green rectangle 200 pixels by 10 pixels in size from pixel locations (0,0) to (0,200)
- As a user, I want to be able to add a shape once or multiple times
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a specific shape
- As a user, I want to be able to clear all the shapes

#### Saved for next part of the project
- ~~As a user, I want to be able to load in an image~~ 
- ~~As a user, I want to be able to see the shape overlaid on the image~~
