# My Personal Project - A Biomechanical Analysis Tool

## An application that allows users to *draw* on images or videos

**Application Features**
- Loading in an image/file
- Drawing on the image/file (e.g. A line from position (x1,y1) to (x2,y2))
- Deleting/erasing drawings
- Saving drawings

**Application Audience**
- Sports enthusiasts
- Sport coaches

**Project Inspiration**
- As a golfing enthusiast myself, I've often wondered if my body was doing what it was supposed to.
AKA *Feel vs Real*. Being able to have an application where I can draw a line on top of a body segment and see the relative
position changes will help me improve my swing!
